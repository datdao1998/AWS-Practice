1. Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
* AWS Inspector
TCP port 23 which is associated with 'Telnet' is reachable from the internet
TCP port 21 which is associated with 'FTP' is reachable from the internet
TCP port 20 which is associated with 'FTP' is reachable from the internet

* AWS Security Hub
Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22
Ensure the default security group of every VPC restricts all traffic
Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 3389
Ensure MFA is enabled for the "root" account
Ensure the S3 bucket used to store CloudTrail logs is not publicly accessible

2. Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
Enable VPC flow logging
Provide specific IP address range for security groups ingress on port 22,3389
Enable access logging on CloudTrail S3 bucket

# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
I try to attack from Attack Instance, against Web Instance (which is shown in image attached). But it took a long time but I can see any log in GuardDuty.

# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
